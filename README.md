# find_my_tennis

A new Flutter project that uses google maps integration to help users find tennis courts and clubs near them and around the world.

## Getting Started

This project has deliberately excluded some crucial files in order to make it work. These include:

lib/utlities/app_secrets.dart
<br>
ios/Runner/Constants.swift
<br>
android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
<br>
<br>
and the necessary config files for Firebase.
